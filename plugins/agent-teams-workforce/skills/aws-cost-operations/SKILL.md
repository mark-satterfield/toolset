# AWS Cost & Operations

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for AWS cost optimization, monitoring, observability, and operational excellence with integrated MCP servers.

## AWS Documentation Requirement

Always verify AWS facts using MCP tools (`mcp__aws-mcp__*` or `mcp__*awsdocs*__*`) before answering. The `aws-mcp-setup` dependency is auto-loaded — if MCP tools are unavailable, guide the user through that skill's setup flow.

## Cost Tools and Method

Cost work goes through the AWS MCP server tools the agent holds, following `aws-core:aws-billing-and-cost-management`:
- **Pricing and estimates**: the Pricing API through the AWS MCP server's `run_script`, and AWS pricing pages through `search_documentation` and `read_documentation`; for DynamoDB, `compute_performances_and_costs` where the agent holds it
- **Actual spend, anomalies and budgets**: the Cost Explorer, Cost Anomaly Detection and Budgets APIs through `run_script`
- **Check the current date first**, before any Cost Explorer, Budgets or forecast call, so every time range is right
- **Every calculation is scripted**: monthly totals, unit costs and comparisons are computed in a script (`run_script` or a scratchpad script), never by reasoning, and the script's output is what the result reports

**Scale**: size every estimate to the stated development context: one development AWS account and at most five users. Do not plan for growth or hypothetical production load. Where a requirement can be met either way, prefer per-request pricing (for example Lambda, DynamoDB on-demand); where the architecture uses a service with a capacity floor (for example Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 at its minimum ACUs, which is 0 only with automatic pause), size it to the stated context and report its monthly floor.

#### Amazon CloudWatch MCP Server (`cw`)
**Purpose**: Metrics, alarms, and logs analysis
- Query CloudWatch metrics and logs
- Create and manage CloudWatch alarms
- Troubleshoot operational issues
- Monitor resource utilization

> **Note**: The following servers are available separately via the Full AWS MCP Server (see `aws-mcp-setup` skill) and are not bundled with this plugin:
> - AWS Billing and Cost Management MCP — Real-time billing details
> - CloudWatch Application Signals MCP — APM and SLOs
> - AWS Managed Prometheus MCP — PromQL queries for containers
> - AWS CloudTrail MCP — API activity audit
> - AWS Well-Architected Security Assessment MCP — Security posture assessment

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Optimizing AWS costs and reducing spending
- Estimating costs before deployment
- Monitoring application and infrastructure performance
- Setting up observability and alerting
- Analyzing spending patterns and trends
- Investigating operational issues
- Auditing AWS activity and changes
- Assessing security posture
- Implementing operational excellence

## Cost Optimization Best Practices

### Pre-Deployment Cost Estimation

**Always estimate costs before deploying**:
1. Get resource prices through the AWS MCP server (Pricing API, AWS pricing pages)
2. Compare pricing across different regions
3. Evaluate alternative service options
4. Calculate expected monthly costs in a script
5. Use the stated development context (one account, at most five users) as the volume, never projected growth

**Example workflow**:
```
"Estimate the monthly cost of running a Lambda function with
1 million invocations, 512MB memory, 3-second duration in us-east-1"
```

### Cost Analysis and Optimization

**Regular cost reviews**:
1. Use the Cost Explorer API through the AWS MCP server to analyze spending trends
2. Identify cost anomalies and unexpected charges
3. Review costs by service, region, and environment
4. Compare actual vs. budgeted costs
5. Generate cost optimization recommendations

**Cost optimization strategies**:
- Right-size over-provisioned resources
- Use appropriate storage classes (S3, EBS)
- Implement auto-scaling for dynamic workloads
- Savings Plans and Reserved Instances are out of scope until a stated steady-state workload justifies a commitment
- Delete unused resources and snapshots
- Use cost allocation tags effectively

### Budget Monitoring

**Track spending against budgets**:
1. Use the Budgets API through the AWS MCP server to monitor budgets
2. Set up budget alerts for threshold breaches
3. Review budget utilization regularly
4. Adjust budgets based on trends
5. Implement cost controls and governance

## Monitoring and Observability Best Practices

### CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms

**Implement comprehensive monitoring**:
1. Use **CloudWatch MCP** to query metrics and logs
2. Set up alarms for critical metrics:
   - CPU and memory utilization
   - Error rates and latency
   - Queue depths and processing times
   - API gateway throttling
   - Lambda errors and timeouts
3. Create CloudWatch dashboards for visualization
4. Use log insights for troubleshooting

**Example alarm scenarios**:
- Lambda error rate > 1%
- EC2 CPU utilization > 80%
- API Gateway 4xx/5xx error spike
- DynamoDB throttled requests
- ECS task failures

### Application Performance Monitoring

**Monitor application health**:
1. Use **CloudWatch Application Signals MCP** for APM
2. Track service-level objectives (SLOs)
3. Monitor application dependencies
4. Identify performance bottlenecks
5. Set up distributed tracing

### Container and Kubernetes Monitoring

This section applies to a workload that runs on ECS or EKS. A serverless workload on Lambda is observed with CloudWatch, X-Ray and ADOT instead; which applies is in the project's architecture.

**For containerized workloads**:
1. Use **AWS Managed Prometheus MCP** for metrics
2. Monitor container resource utilization
3. Track pod and node health
4. Create PromQL queries for custom metrics
5. Set up alerts for container anomalies

## Audit and Security Best Practices

### CloudTrail Activity Analysis

**Audit AWS activity**:
1. Use **CloudTrail MCP** to analyze API activity
2. Track who made changes to resources
3. Investigate security incidents
4. Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
5. Audit compliance with policies

**Common audit scenarios**:
- "Who deleted this S3 bucket?"
- "Show all IAM role changes in the last 24 hours"
- "List failed login attempts"
- "Find all actions by a specific user"
- "Track modifications to security groups"

### Security Assessment

**Regular security reviews**:
1. Use **Well-Architected Security Assessment MCP**
2. Assess security posture against best practices
3. Identify security gaps and vulnerabilities
4. Implement recommended security improvements
5. Document security compliance

**Security assessment areas**:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Detective controls and monitoring
- Infrastructure protection
- Data protection and encryption
- Incident response preparedness

## Using MCP Servers Effectively

### Cost Analysis Workflow

1. **Pre-deployment**: estimate costs from the Pricing API through the AWS MCP server, calculated in a script
2. **Post-deployment**: track actual spending with the Cost Explorer and Budgets APIs through the AWS MCP server
3. **Analysis**: break costs down by service, tag and usage type, calculated in a script
4. **Optimization**: act on findings that fit the development context

### Monitoring Workflow

1. **Setup**: Configure CloudWatch metrics and alarms
2. **Monitor**: Use CloudWatch MCP to track key metrics
3. **Analyze**: Use Application Signals for APM insights
4. **Troubleshoot**: Query CloudWatch Logs for issue resolution

### Security Workflow

1. **Audit**: Use CloudTrail MCP to review activity
2. **Assess**: Use Well-Architected Security Assessment
3. **Remediate**: Implement security recommendations
4. **Monitor**: Track security events via CloudWatch

### MCP Usage Best Practices

1. **Cost Awareness**: Check pricing before deploying resources
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: Set up alarms for critical metrics
3. **Regular Reviews**: Analyze costs and performance weekly
4. **Audit Trails**: Review CloudTrail logs for compliance
5. **Security First**: Run security assessments regularly
6. **Optimize Continuously**: Act on cost and performance recommendations

## Operational Excellence Guidelines

### Cost Optimization

- **Tag Everything**: Use consistent cost allocation tags
- **Review Monthly**: Analyze spending trends and anomalies
- **Right-size**: Match resources to actual usage
- **Automate**: Use auto-scaling and scheduling
- **Monitor Budgets**: Set alerts for cost overruns

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **Critical Metrics**: Alert on business-critical metrics
- **Noise Reduction**: Fine-tune thresholds to reduce false positives
- **Actionable Alerts**: Ensure alerts have clear remediation steps
- **Dashboard Visibility**: Create dashboards for key stakeholders
- **Log Retention**: Balance cost and compliance needs

### Security and Compliance

- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions
- **Audit Regularly**: Review CloudTrail logs for anomalies
