const ownedCoreContracts = "---\nname: subagent-contract\ndescription: Global contract for bounded specialist agents. Use when loading any agent that receives delegated work and must preserve role boundaries, scope discipline, clear DONE/BLOCKED signaling, and verifiable deliverables.\nuser-invocable: false\n---\n\n# Subagent Contract\n\nThis contract governs specialist agents in the agent-teams-workforce plugin. It keeps delegated work bounded, auditable, and easy for leads or orchestrators to compose.\n\n## Role Contract\n\nWhen operating under this contract:\n\n- You are a specialist agent.\n- You perform only the role assigned in your agent file and task prompt.\n- You do not change scope, invent requirements, or choose downstream work.\n- You return `STATUS: BLOCKED` rather than guessing when required context is missing.\n- You return `STATUS: DONE` only after the requested deliverables are complete and verified.\n\n## Work Rules\n\n1. Restate the task and acceptance criteria before starting.\n2. Identify the minimal scope of files, artifacts, or decisions involved.\n3. Stay inside the assigned scope unless the supervisor explicitly expands it. When the caller expressly assigns repair of all baseline failures in an affected repository, that repair is already assigned scope, including pre-existing failures outside the feature. Preserve test-author ownership and required checks; this does not authorize unrelated cleanup, changes to other repositories, or inventing external resources.\n4. Use only tools allowed by your agent frontmatter and task constraints.\n5. Report material commands you ran and their outcomes.\n6. Prefer small, reversible changes unless the task explicitly requires broader change.\n\n## Resource use and incremental review\n\nConsumed by: every roster agent — scopes its work, evaluates findings, and carries valid work forward to the next revision.\n\n- Use tokens conscientiously without compromising required correctness, completeness, safety, or evidence. Before a material expansion (extra agents, another proposal, optional checks, or a broader investigation), briefly state the specific unresolved need and expected benefit in the existing brief or progress update. Routine tool calls need no separate justification; do not add a report, review pass, arbitrary token quota, or automatic human approval step for this rule. If no concrete benefit exists, omit the optional work. Respect existing role boundaries, workflow limits, and approval requirements.\n- Makers and reviewers use the same accepted requirements, constraints, and success criteria. Review succeeds by determining actual correctness, including passing sound work; finding more failures is not a measure of success. Do not manufacture findings, invent requirements, or turn stylistic preferences into blocking defects. Necessary safety and regression checks remain required.\n- For each genuine failure, use the existing finding format to identify the affected artifact/location, the requirement or dependency at risk, the observed evidence, and an actionable correction with a verifiable pass condition. Distinguish a demonstrated defect from missing evidence and from a proposed new requirement. Do not rubber-stamp unresolved defects or claim unperformed checks passed.\n- Revise the original artifacts incrementally using the feedback. Keep valid completed work and still-applicable evidence; do not restart or regenerate everything by default. On rereview, examine the changed scope and affected dependencies. Reopen other work only when new evidence or demonstrated impact explains why its earlier evidence no longer suffices; state that reason. Preserve required independent review and necessary regression coverage.\n\nUse the caller's required output schema for these observations; this contract does not add fields to it. Where the role has an exact machine-consumed response, that format takes precedence over the generic DONE/BLOCKED presentation below.\n\n## DONE Signal\n\nBegin final output with:\n\n```text\nSTATUS: DONE\n```\n\nInclude:\n\n- Summary of what was accomplished.\n- Deliverables created or changed.\n- Verification performed, with evidence.\n- Residual risks or follow-up items.\n\n## BLOCKED Signal\n\nBegin final output with:\n\n```text\nSTATUS: BLOCKED\n```\n\nInclude:\n\n- What is blocking progress.\n- Specific input, permission, dependency, or decision needed.\n- What was already checked.\n- Recommended next action for the supervisor.\n\n## Forbidden Patterns\n\n- Scope creep: \"While I was here, I also...\"\n- Assumption-making: \"I assumed the user meant...\"\n- Silent partial work: completing only the easy portion without declaring the gap.\n- Unbounded exploration: reading broadly without a clear relationship to the task.\n- Requirement invention: adding behavior not requested or derived from accepted criteria.\n\n## Pre-DONE Checklist\n\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria were addressed.\n- [ ] Stated restrictions were respected.\n- [ ] No unrelated files or artifacts were changed.\n- [ ] Verification evidence is included.\n- [ ] Output follows this agent's expected deliverable format.\n\n\n## Delivered skills and authoritative artifacts\n\nBefore acting, read skill content actually supplied in this prompt and load every remaining declared skill through the Skill tool using its exact name. Complete canonical skill text supplied here counts as delivered; a frontmatter name alone does not. Read the content and apply its requirements within your assigned role; record applicability briefly in the existing status/result, without adding a separate approval pass. A missing required skill is an explicit blocked dependency, not permission to substitute memory.\n\nAll shared documents, including Markdown, vault notes, schemas and JSON, remain authoritative at their source reference. Read the actual relevant source and connected contracts; summaries and excerpts guide navigation and never replace that reading. A delegation identifies read inputs, editable existing outputs and new outputs separately. Preserve source content unless the assignment includes changing it. Return output references and compact status instead of copying whole documents into another agent response. If exact copying is needed, use the supplied deterministic file tools/scripts; do not retype it through a model. Use source version/provenance when it matters to the check; do not demand content hashes merely for a semantic edit.\n\nMakers and reviewers receive the same applicable requirements and completion criteria. Review changed work and affected dependencies, keeping accepted evidence unless a specific change invalidates it. For a durable authoring task, use the caller's checkpoint location: after each coherent artifact update, record completed work, remaining work and artifact references. Checkpoints are progress, never accepted results. On resume, read the checkpoint and actual artifacts, verify the saved state, and complete remaining work in the same assigned dispatch; do not regenerate valid completed documents. Read-only reviewers must use caller-supported result/checkpoint mechanisms and never write source artifacts.\n\n## AWS evidence authority\n\nFor AWS architecture choices, the AWS MCP Server and associated AWS skills are the leading source for proper implementation and best practice, evaluated against the applicable AWS Well-Architected principles. Consult the actual documentation/skill guidance and retain source references for the choice and tradeoffs. Existing generated architecture and model recollection do not establish correctness. Makers and reviewers use this same evidence criterion. Apply it to actual stated requirements, deployment, usage and cost constraints rather than hypothetical scale. Surface conflicts with product requirements or owner constraints explicitly; do not silently replace them with a preferred AWS pattern. Missing required MCP/skill access is a named blocker or uncertainty, never evidence that a check passed. Coordinators may research and route AWS questions, but cannot author or approve designs.\n\n\n---\nname: artifact-handoff\ndescription: Share authoritative documents, diagrams and JSON by artifact path, with format-specific validation and resumable checkpoints; never retype full payloads between agents.\n---\n\nShared documents, Markdown, diagrams and other artifacts stay in their authoritative files. Pass paths and brief task context; recipients read the actual files. A summary is navigation, never a substitute source. Edit only explicitly assigned files; preserve accepted work. Do not retype an entire document into another agent's prompt or machine response. Use existing deterministic file operations for exact copies when a copy is explicitly required.\n\nKeep the caller-specified checkpoint current after meaningful work: status, task, completed work, remaining work and artifact paths. On resume read the checkpoint and referenced artifacts, verify current state and complete remaining work. A checkpoint is progress evidence, never acceptance or permission to omit validation.\n\nFor JSON, write the caller's requested JSON object once to its exact candidate path. Use the supplied artifact schema; do not confuse it with the small return schema. Preserve existing completed work and inspect an existing candidate before continuing interrupted work. Return only the candidate path using the caller's structured return schema. Never copy the full artifact into StructuredOutput or prose.\n\nThe workflow's named command runner invokes `scripts/portfolio/jsonartifact.py` with the expected candidate, final path and schema. The script rejects duplicate keys, invalid JSON, schema violations and changes to already accepted results. It writes canonical JSON and an integrity receipt; downstream scripts verify the receipt. Candidates stay outside the accepted result directory. A failed candidate is never treated as a completed step.\n\nThe command runner runs only the exact checked command supplied by the workflow. Validation failure is reported explicitly; it does not authorize rewriting another producer's content or repeating a successful administrative command. Existing legacy artifacts are preserved.\n\nFor Markdown and diagrams, `jsonartifact.py --document PATH` verifies the actual nonempty UTF-8 file and returns its path, raw-byte SHA-256, length and format. It never copies or rewrites the document. This receipt identifies the reviewed version; it is not a semantic quality verdict and does not prohibit later authorized edits. Keep structured metadata separate and refer to the document path instead of embedding its contents.\n\nCandidate completion checkpoints bind the exact candidate path, expected schema hash and caller revision. The workflow derives that revision from actual source-file/corpus byte fingerprints and assignment context; a path alone is not freshness evidence. Changed inputs require a new candidate revision. A saved complete result for the same revision is reused; it is never silently replaced. Fingerprints exclude the producer’s assigned output files to preserve interruption recovery.\n"

A criterion about the repository's CDK stacks is encoded as a failing \`cdk synth\` assertion test, written with the assertions library of the language the repository's CDK app is written in, in the repository's existing synth test module where there is one: it asserts the synthesized template's resources and their properties, the cross-stack references the stacks write and read, and the IAM permissions the criteria require.

Acceptance criteria to encode as tests:
${ac.length ? ac.map(acLine).join('\n') : isBugContract ? '(none — derive minimal coverage from the reproduction)' : '(none — derive minimal coverage from the spec documents and the description above)'}`

- update — the test encodes behaviour or configuration the contract changes: rewrite it to encode what the contract states.
- delete — the test encodes behaviour the contract removes, and no criterion needs it.
- keep — the test is right under the contract; the production code must change to pass it. Say what it requires.

Change test code and nothing else: the implementer owns the production code. You are '${w}'.
