// `agent()` fails in two different ways and the scripts used to conflate them. It
// RETURNS NULL when a subagent is skipped or dies on a terminal API error after the
// runtime's own retries. It THROWS when a subagent finishes without calling
// StructuredOutput — and an uncaught throw leaves this script, leaves whatever
// composite called it, and kills the run: two recorded crashes cost 1.13M and 1.88M
// tokens and discarded every artifact the run had already paid for.
//
// So every dispatch in this file goes through settleAgent(). A throw never escapes it,
// and it records what the engine's error text loses — that text reads
// `agent({schema}): subagent completed without calling StructuredOutput`, which names
// neither the agent, nor the phase, nor the schema, and points at no transcript. The
// caller receives null, which every call site already handles, and `dispatchFailures`
// carries the identity of what died, for the `dispatchFailed` report this script owes
// its caller: a phase whose producing agents died is NOT adjudicated.
//
// Each `dispatchFailures` entry ALSO carries the CAUSE — see failureCause below — because
// a caller that can only see THAT a dispatch produced nothing cannot tell the one failure
// worth sending again from the many that are not. `failureCauseFor(label)` is how a call
// site reads it back, and a TRANSIENT cause is waited out inside settleAgent itself, so
// every dispatch in every script survives an API overload rather than only some of them.

// import mechanism, so a shared helper is shared by being the same text everywhere.

// ── WHY A DISPATCH FAILED DECIDES WHETHER ANYTHING MAY BE SENT AGAIN ─────────────
//
// settleAgent used to collapse every failure into a single null, and that conflation is
// the same defect that let a destroyed answer look like a dead agent: a call site could
// see THAT a dispatch produced nothing and never WHY. Two causes need opposite answers,
// and getting them the same way round is what makes this a classification and not a
// retry loop wearing a hat.
//
// TRANSIENT — an Anthropic API overload (529), a rate limit (429), a quota or token
// limit, a network timeout. The cause is EXTERNAL and TIME-VARYING, the input was never
// the problem, and the call that failed produced nothing to pay for. Waiting and sending
// the same dispatch again therefore has a real reason to come out differently, which is
// the only thing that ever justifies a second attempt. This is the one case retried here,
// and it is retried until it clears — see the backoff below. It is never answered by
// splitting the input: the input was fine, and splitting multiplies calls against an
// endpoint that is already failing to serve the first one.
//
// DETERMINISTIC — a schema rejection, an agent that finished without producing output,
// anything settled by arithmetic. Re-issuing the identical dispatch against the identical
// input has NO reason to produce a different result; it is a hope with a token cost, and
// this project removed exactly those blind retries after they burned tokens to exhaustion
// on attempts that could not succeed. The only sanctioned re-dispatch is one with
// materially CHANGED input — for the SAD batches, the split.
//
// ANYTHING UNRECOGNISED IS DETERMINISTIC, and that direction is deliberate rather than
// defensive. Guessing "transient" on an unknown error invents a retry that is forbidden
// and pays for it on every unfamiliar failure; guessing "deterministic" at worst declines
// a retry that might have worked, and the caller still has its split and its report. The
// cheap mistake is the one to take.
//
// This block is identical in every workflow script, on purpose. Workflow scripts have no
// import mechanism, so a shared helper is shared by being the same text.

// ── A TRANSIENT FAILURE IS WAITED OUT, NOT COUNTED DOWN ─────────────────────────
//
// An API overload is a server-side condition with its own clock. It clears in thirty
// seconds, or five minutes, or fifteen; nothing this script does shortens it, and a failed
// call costs nothing, so there is nothing here to conserve by giving up. A run started in
// the evening must still be running in the morning, having sat out whatever happened at
// 3am and carried on by itself. So there is NO attempt ceiling and no elapsed-time budget:
// the wait grows, flattens at five minutes, and repeats at five minutes for as long as the
// endpoint keeps failing. If you are about to add a maximum, you are re-introducing the
// defect this replaced — a two-attempt budget that guaranteed a back-to-back second
// failure and then quit.
//
// The schedule: 5s, then triple each time, capped at 300s — 5, 15, 45, 135, 300, 300, …
// Five seconds is short enough that a brief blip costs seconds rather than minutes; a
// factor of three reaches the cap on the fifth wait, about eight minutes in, so a genuine
// outage is at the polite five-minute cadence quickly instead of hammering the endpoint
// for an hour of doublings.
//
// JITTER exists because these lanes run concurrently. Identical waits make every lane that
// failed together return together, which is the thundering herd arriving at an endpoint
// that is already struggling. Each wait is therefore 50–100% of the scheduled interval:
// the growth shape survives, and the lanes spread out.
//
// The offset is DERIVED, never drawn. A workflow script cannot draw a random number — a
// resumed run would draw a different one — and it does not need to: what jitter has to
// vary across is LANES, not runs. Hashing the dispatch's own identity together with the
// attempt number gives concurrent lanes different offsets, which is the whole requirement,
// and gives a resumed run the same one, which is the house rule.
//
// THE WAIT IS LOGGED, and that is the point of it being allowed to be this long. Every
// retry prints the attempt number, the wait about to be taken and the TOTAL time spent
// waiting so far, so someone reading a log at 3am can tell a run patiently sitting out an
// outage from a run that is hung.
