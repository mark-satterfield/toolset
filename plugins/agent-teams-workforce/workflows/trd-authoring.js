// RETURNS NULL when a subagent is skipped or dies on a terminal API error after the
// runtime's own retries. It THROWS when a subagent finishes without calling
// StructuredOutput — and an uncaught throw leaves this script, leaves whatever
// composite called it, and kills the run: two recorded crashes cost 1.13M and 1.88M
// tokens and discarded every artifact the run had already paid for.
//
// So every dispatch in this file goes through settleAgent(). A throw never escapes it,
// and it records what the engine's error text loses — that text reads
// `agent({schema}): subagent completed without calling StructuredOutput`, which names
// neither the agent, nor the phase, nor the schema, and points at no transcript. The
// caller receives null, which every call site already handles, and `dispatchFailures`
// carries the identity of what died, for the `dispatchFailed` report this script owes
// its caller: a phase whose producing agents died is NOT adjudicated.

  written, a Task already planned or already built — is now wrong, or would be built wrong,
  because of what you changed. False when the change is routine: a restatement, a status
  move, a checkpoint, or a fact nothing else reads.
- \`kind\`: what sort of thing changed; \`none\` when material is false.
- \`summary\`: ONE sentence naming what others depend on — the fact, not the edit.
- \`decisionIds\`: the durable SAD entry tags this change creates, changes or retires, written
  exactly as the SAD writes them. Empty when none apply.
- \`suspectedImpact\`: what you suspect is affected, named as plainly as you can — a document, a
  repository, a feature. A suspicion is useful; a guess dressed as a finding is not.

SAD extract (architecture constraints/strategy/crosscutting the TRD must honor; cite by stable ID):
${extractText}
${feedback ? `\nFeedback on the previous version (checker, gate or decider) — address every point:\n${feedback}` : ''}

Each technical requirement must have a stable ID, trace upward to a PRD requirement, cite any SAD source IDs it depends on, and be verifiable. Deliver the TRD file path(s) you wrote, the structured requirements, and the upstream PRD/SAD references each requirement carries.

CITE THE DECISIONS, IN THE DOCUMENT AS WELL AS IN YOUR RESULT.
A \`sadRefs\` entry that reaches only your structured result is read by this run and by nothing after it. The TRD file itself carries the citation twice:
- in YAML frontmatter at the top of the document, \`decisionIds:\` listing every SAD entry id any requirement in this TRD depends on, as a flat list;
- and on each requirement, naming the ids that requirement depends on.
Cite the SAD's own entry tags exactly as the extract writes them (\`C-…\`, \`S-…\`, \`X-…\`, \`AD-…\`). Never invent an id, never paraphrase one, and never cite a section number in place of one — a section number moves, a tag does not.${persistBrief(ART, 'trd.md', 'the complete TRD as a markdown document', { beadKey: 'trd' })}${materialChangeBrief(ART, 'trd')}`,

CHECK 1 — structure and quality (return under \`validation\`): required sections present, every requirement has a stable ID and a concrete verification method, requirements are unambiguous and testable, and the TRD is internally consistent with the SAD extract it cites. verdict "pass" only if every check holds; otherwise "reject" with feedback specific enough that the author can fix it without interpretation, and each finding with its severity.

CHECK 2 — bidirectional PRD<->TRD traceability (return under \`traceability\`): every PRD requirement maps forward to at least one TRD requirement (no coverage gaps), and every TRD requirement maps back to a PRD requirement (no orphans). Build the traceability matrix and report gaps in both directions. verdict "pass" only if traceability is complete in BOTH directions with no unexplained gaps or orphans.
