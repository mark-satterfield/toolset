const ownedCoreContracts = "---\nname: subagent-contract\ndescription: >-\n  Shared contract for bounded specialist assignments: preserve role and scope, follow\n  the caller's response format, retain verifiable artifacts, and report incomplete work explicitly.\nuser-invocable: false\n---\n\n# Subagent Contract\n\n## Caller contract comes first\n\nFollow the caller's exact response schema and artifact protocol. Do not prepend `STATUS`, restate the task, add report fields, or append commentary to a machine-consumed response. Put evidence, findings, progress and blockers only in the artifacts or fields the caller provides. An artifact's on-disk schema and the response-reference schema serve different purposes; do not return the artifact body when the caller requests only its path.\n\nWhen an executable submission/checkpoint tool is supplied, use it to validate the authored result, compute bindings and construct the response. Return its successful response unchanged through the requested channel. Do not manually manufacture completion flags or hashes. Structural validation proves neither semantic correctness nor review approval. On failure preserve work and report the exact remaining work or blocker through the caller's supported mechanism; never send a success reference for an incomplete assignment. If the supplied protocol has no failure channel, report that incompatibility to the caller rather than inventing a successful response.\n\nOnly when the caller supplies no response format, use `STATUS: DONE` or `STATUS: BLOCKED` with a concise description of deliverables and verification, or the blocker and what is needed. Claim DONE only when the assigned work is complete and verified. No separate preliminary restatement or generic final report is required.\n\n## Role and scope\n\n- Perform only the role assigned in the agent definition and task. Do not invent requirements, select downstream work or enlarge your authority.\n- Identify the minimal relevant files, artifacts and decisions. Use only allowed tools and preserve file ownership. Read-only reviewers may write caller-authorized result/checkpoint artifacts, never source artifacts.\n- An explicit assignment to repair all baseline failures in an affected repository includes pre-existing failures there. Preserve test-author ownership and required checks; this does not authorize unrelated cleanup, other repositories or invented external resources.\n- Prefer small, reversible changes unless the assignment requires broader change. Report material actions and their outcomes in the existing evidence channel, without adding fields to a fixed schema.\n- Missing required context is a named dependency, not permission to guess. Distinguish facts, justified assumptions and unresolved questions; do not silently complete only the easy portion.\n\n## Skills and authoritative artifacts\n\nRead canonical skill content already delivered in the prompt; do not reload it solely because its name also appears in frontmatter. Assess which other declared skills apply and load those through the Skill tool using their exact names. A name alone is not delivered content. A missing required skill is an explicit dependency; do not substitute recollection. Note material applicability decisions only in existing progress/evidence channels that permit them, never by expanding the return schema.\n\nRead the actual relevant source sections and connected contracts. Shared Markdown, vault notes, diagrams, schemas and JSON stay authoritative at their paths; summaries guide navigation and do not replace source verification. Observe assigned read/edit/create ownership. Preserve content unless its change is assigned. Pass references rather than copying whole documents between agents. When exact copying is required, use deterministic file tools rather than model transcription. Use version/provenance where relevant; do not require hashes merely for semantic editing.\n\nFor durable authoring, checkpoint meaningful progress using the caller's location and executable mechanism where supplied. Record completed work, remaining work and artifact references; blocked progress names the dependency and reason. Checkpoints are progress, not accepted results. On resume verify the checkpoint against actual artifacts and finish missing work without regenerating valid completed documents.\n\n## Resource use and incremental review\n\n- Use tokens conscientiously without compromising required correctness, completeness, safety or evidence. Before a material optional expansion, identify its unresolved need and expected benefit in existing progress. Routine tools need no justification. Do not add a report, review pass, token quota or human approval gate for this rule; omit optional work with no concrete benefit.\n- Makers and reviewers use the same applicable requirements, constraints and completion criteria. Review determines actual correctness, including passing sound work; finding more failures is not success. Do not invent requirements or turn stylistic preferences into blocking defects. Preserve necessary safety and regression checks.\n- Use the caller's finding format to identify the affected location, requirement/dependency at risk, observed evidence and actionable correction with a verifiable pass condition. Distinguish defects, missing evidence and proposed new requirements. Never claim unperformed checks passed.\n- Revise original artifacts incrementally. Retain valid work and applicable evidence. Rereview changed scope and affected dependencies; reopen accepted work only when new evidence or demonstrated impact invalidates its earlier evidence, and state why. Preserve required independent review.\n\n## AWS evidence authority\n\nFor applicable AWS architecture choices, consult actual AWS MCP Server documentation and relevant AWS skills, including applicable Well-Architected principles. Retain source references and the concrete tradeoffs. Existing generated architecture and model recollection do not establish correctness. Makers and reviewers use this same evidence criterion.\n\nApply guidance to stated requirements, deployment, usage and cost constraints rather than hypothetical scale. Surface conflicts with product requirements or owner constraints; do not silently substitute a preferred AWS pattern. Missing required MCP/skill access is a named blocker or uncertainty, never a passed check. Coordinators may research and route AWS questions, but cannot author or approve designs.\n\n\n---\nname: artifact-handoff\ndescription: Share authoritative documents, diagrams and JSON by artifact path, with format-specific validation and resumable checkpoints; never retype full payloads between agents.\n---\n\nShared documents, Markdown, diagrams and other artifacts stay in their authoritative files. Pass paths and brief task context; recipients read the actual files. A summary is navigation, never a substitute source. Edit only explicitly assigned files; preserve accepted work. Do not retype an entire document into another agent's prompt or machine response. Use existing deterministic file operations for exact copies when a copy is explicitly required.\n\nKeep the caller-specified checkpoint current after meaningful work: status, task, completed work, remaining work and artifact paths. On resume read the checkpoint and referenced artifacts, verify current state and complete remaining work. A checkpoint is progress evidence, never acceptance or permission to omit validation.\n\nFor JSON, write the caller's requested JSON object once to its exact candidate path. Use the supplied artifact schema; do not confuse it with the small return schema. Preserve existing completed work and inspect an existing candidate before continuing interrupted work. Return only the candidate path using the caller's structured return schema. Never copy the full artifact into StructuredOutput or prose.\n\nThe workflow's named command runner invokes `scripts/portfolio/jsonartifact.py` with the expected candidate, final path and schema. The script rejects duplicate keys, invalid JSON, schema violations and changes to already accepted results. It writes canonical JSON and an integrity receipt; downstream scripts verify the receipt. Candidates stay outside the accepted result directory. A failed candidate is never treated as a completed step.\n\nThe command runner runs only the exact checked command supplied by the workflow. Validation failure is reported explicitly; it does not authorize rewriting another producer's content or repeating a successful administrative command. Existing legacy artifacts are preserved.\n\nFor Markdown and diagrams, `jsonartifact.py --document PATH` verifies the actual nonempty UTF-8 file and returns its path, raw-byte SHA-256, length and format. It never copies or rewrites the document. This receipt identifies the reviewed version; it is not a semantic quality verdict and does not prohibit later authorized edits. Keep structured metadata separate and refer to the document path instead of embedding its contents.\n\nCandidate completion checkpoints bind the exact candidate path, expected schema hash and caller revision. The workflow derives that revision from actual source-file/corpus byte fingerprints and assignment context; a path alone is not freshness evidence. Changed inputs require a new candidate revision. A saved complete result for the same revision is reused; it is never silently replaced. Fingerprints exclude the producer’s assigned output files to preserve interruption recovery.\n\n## Executable producer contract\n\nUse the caller's canonical schema for both production and review; architecture uses [writer](schemas/architecture-writer.schema.json) and [reviewer](schemas/architecture-review.schema.json). Never maintain a second schema in prose. The [checkpoint schema](schemas/checkpoint.schema.json) is shared by producer status commands.\n\nResolve `scripts/portfolio/artifactcontract.py` from this plugin's root (two directories above this skill). The workflow supplies the candidate path, canonical schema and input revision. Pass exactly one of `--schema-file PATH` or `--schema-json JSON`; both use identical strict parsing, validation and canonical hashing. Prefer the schema file when the caller supplies one. Author a small progress JSON file with `task`, `completed`, `remaining`, and `artifacts`; add `reason` when blocked. Do not put binding hashes or completion flags in that file: the helper computes them.\n\n```bash\npython3 \"$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/portfolio/artifactcontract.py\" checkpoint --candidate \"$CANDIDATE\" --schema-file \"$SCHEMA\" --revision \"$REVISION\" --progress-file \"$PROGRESS\" --status in-progress\npython3 \"$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/portfolio/artifactcontract.py\" complete --candidate \"$CANDIDATE\" --schema-file \"$SCHEMA\" --revision \"$REVISION\" --progress-file \"$PROGRESS\"\npython3 \"$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/portfolio/artifactcontract.py\" status --candidate \"$CANDIDATE\" --schema-file \"$SCHEMA\" --revision \"$REVISION\"\n```\n\nFor a dependency you cannot satisfy, checkpoint with `--status blocked` and its exact `reason` and remaining work. Do not mark incomplete reasoning complete merely to satisfy the schema. `complete` requires no remaining work, validates strict JSON against the canonical schema, canonicalizes the candidate and writes its bound checkpoint. Return only the candidate reference after that command succeeds. `validate` performs schema validation without mutation. Invalid commands return exit 2 with an explicit error.\n\n`complete-unaccepted` means structurally ready for the workflow's existing acceptance operation, not technically correct, approved, or shipped. Reviewers read the authoritative artifacts and independently judge evidence; mechanically valid metadata cannot establish their correctness. Status detects changed candidate bytes and changed input/schema bindings. Resume `in-progress`/`blocked` work from its actual artifacts; do not restart completed reasoning or silently retry an unchanged blocker.\n\nThe coordinator may use `scripts/portfolio/artifactpublish.py --record-argv-json JSON -- <jsonartifact acceptance arguments>` to validate/publish and record provenance in one deterministic invocation. The recorder receives argv, not shell text, and must name the accepted artifact. Pending or rejected candidates are never recorded; recorder failure reports failure and retains the accepted artifact for recovery. This replaces separate administrative agent calls without replacing specialist reasoning or independent review.\n\nFor the actual handoff use `submit` with the same arguments as `complete`: it validates and writes the checkpoint, then emits exactly the response object `{\"artifactPath\":\"...\"}`. Return that object unchanged. The schema describes the on-disk candidate; the response contains only its reference. A failed submission emits an error and never writes a new completion checkpoint. When the caller supplies `--files-root ROOT --files-field FIELD`, submission also verifies every path in that candidate field is relative to ROOT, stays inside it after symlink resolution, and names a nonempty regular file. These are declared authored outputs, not all assigned or future files. `--progress-artifacts-root ROOT` additionally checks explicitly declared progress artifact paths inside that root; use it only when the caller establishes that scope. These checks establish file existence and structure, not whether the reasoning is correct.\n"

Build to the contract above; do not modify the tests.

When the code cannot pass because a genuinely external dependency or resource does not exist yet (a package, stack, parameter, table or service outside the assigned repair scope), name each such thing in \`upstreamMissing\` with the evidence. A fixable defect or configuration inside explicitly authorized repository baseline repair is not upstreamMissing merely because it predates this Task.
