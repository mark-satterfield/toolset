    "Assesses the architecture dependencies of ONE new or changed Epic, and writes edges and nothing else. An Epic is a PRD, a business requirement, and an Epic edge is an architecture dependency: a judgment about the order in which architecture is established, made before that architecture exists. It exists where an architecture decision one Epic rests on should be designed from another Epic's requirements first, and the SAD does not already settle that decision. It is stored as a beads `tracks` edge that orders elaboration and never holds work out of `bd ready`. ONE epic-sequencer session does the whole assessment: it runs the commands that write the Epic's context, reads the Epic's full PRD, names the architecture decisions its requirements drive and the ones it rests on, drops those the SAD settles, searches the other Epics' PRDs for the requirements that drive or rest on each remaining decision, reads those PRDs in full, applies the edge test in both directions, validates its proposal until the validator passes, and runs apply-edges. apply-edges validates the proposal again and writes nothing unless it passes: it refuses an edge that does not touch the Epic, a cycle, an unaccounted standing edge and a missing reason, confines the write to that Epic's edges, and never touches a hand-made edge. A proposal the session cannot make valid is not applied, and the run stops, naming the Epic and the findings. When the edges are applied it triggers wsjf-scoring, because edges decide RR-OE. With `apply: false` it proposes only: apply-edges computes the edge diff as a dry run, nothing is written and no scoring runs.",

// `agent()` fails in two different ways and the scripts used to conflate them. It
// RETURNS NULL when a subagent is skipped or dies on a terminal API error after the
// runtime's own retries. It THROWS when a subagent finishes without calling
// StructuredOutput — and an uncaught throw leaves this script, leaves whatever
// composite called it, and kills the run: two recorded crashes cost 1.13M and 1.88M
// tokens and discarded every artifact the run had already paid for.
//
// So every dispatch in this file goes through settleAgent(). A throw never escapes it,
// and it records what the engine's error text loses — that text reads
// `agent({schema}): subagent completed without calling StructuredOutput`, which names
// neither the agent, nor the phase, nor the schema, and points at no transcript. The
// caller receives null, which every call site already handles, and `dispatchFailures`
// carries the identity of what died, for the `dispatchFailed` report this script owes
// its caller: a phase whose producing agents died is NOT adjudicated.
//
// Each `dispatchFailures` entry ALSO carries the CAUSE — see failureCause below — because
// a caller that can only see THAT a dispatch produced nothing cannot tell the one failure
// worth sending again from the many that are not. `failureCauseFor(label)` is how a call
// site reads it back, and a TRANSIENT cause is waited out inside settleAgent itself, so
// every dispatch in every script survives an API overload rather than only some of them.

// ── WHY A DISPATCH FAILED DECIDES WHETHER ANYTHING MAY BE SENT AGAIN ─────────────
//
// settleAgent used to collapse every failure into a single null, and that conflation is
// the same defect that let a destroyed answer look like a dead agent: a call site could
// see THAT a dispatch produced nothing and never WHY. Two causes need opposite answers,
// and getting them the same way round is what makes this a classification and not a
// retry loop wearing a hat.
//
// TRANSIENT — an Anthropic API overload (529), a rate limit (429), a quota or token
// limit, a network timeout. The cause is EXTERNAL and TIME-VARYING, the input was never
// the problem, and the call that failed produced nothing to pay for. Waiting and sending
// the same dispatch again therefore has a real reason to come out differently, which is
// the only thing that ever justifies a second attempt. This is the one case retried here,
// and it is retried until it clears — see the backoff below. It is never answered by
// splitting the input: the input was fine, and splitting multiplies calls against an
// endpoint that is already failing to serve the first one.
//
// DETERMINISTIC — a schema rejection, an agent that finished without producing output,
// anything settled by arithmetic. Re-issuing the identical dispatch against the identical
// input has NO reason to produce a different result; it is a hope with a token cost, and
// this project removed exactly those blind retries after they burned tokens to exhaustion
// on attempts that could not succeed. The only sanctioned re-dispatch is one with
// materially CHANGED input — for the SAD batches, the split.
//
// ANYTHING UNRECOGNISED IS DETERMINISTIC, and that direction is deliberate rather than
// defensive. Guessing "transient" on an unknown error invents a retry that is forbidden
// and pays for it on every unfamiliar failure; guessing "deterministic" at worst declines
// a retry that might have worked, and the caller still has its split and its report. The
// cheap mistake is the one to take.
//
// This block is identical in every workflow script, on purpose. Workflow scripts have no
// import mechanism, so a shared helper is shared by being the same text.

// ── A TRANSIENT FAILURE IS WAITED OUT, NOT COUNTED DOWN ─────────────────────────
//
// An API overload is a server-side condition with its own clock. It clears in thirty
// seconds, or five minutes, or fifteen; nothing this script does shortens it, and a failed
// call costs nothing, so there is nothing here to conserve by giving up. A run started in
// the evening must still be running in the morning, having sat out whatever happened at
// 3am and carried on by itself. So there is NO attempt ceiling and no elapsed-time budget:
// the wait grows, flattens at five minutes, and repeats at five minutes for as long as the
// endpoint keeps failing. If you are about to add a maximum, you are re-introducing the
// defect this replaced — a two-attempt budget that guaranteed a back-to-back second
// failure and then quit.
//
// The schedule: 5s, then triple each time, capped at 300s — 5, 15, 45, 135, 300, 300, …
// Five seconds is short enough that a brief blip costs seconds rather than minutes; a
// factor of three reaches the cap on the fifth wait, about eight minutes in, so a genuine
// outage is at the polite five-minute cadence quickly instead of hammering the endpoint
// for an hour of doublings.
//
// JITTER exists because these lanes run concurrently. Identical waits make every lane that
// failed together return together, which is the thundering herd arriving at an endpoint
// that is already struggling. Each wait is therefore 50–100% of the scheduled interval:
// the growth shape survives, and the lanes spread out.
//
// The offset is DERIVED, never drawn. A workflow script cannot draw a random number — a
// resumed run would draw a different one — and it does not need to: what jitter has to
// vary across is LANES, not runs. Hashing the dispatch's own identity together with the
// attempt number gives concurrent lanes different offsets, which is the whole requirement,
// and gives a resumed run the same one, which is the house rule.
//
// THE WAIT IS LOGGED, and that is the point of it being allowed to be this long. Every
// retry prints the attempt number, the wait about to be taken and the TOTAL time spent
// waiting so far, so someone reading a log at 3am can tell a run patiently sitting out an

// ── A LIMIT BELONGS WHERE THE DATA IS MADE, AND AN OVERAGE IS A FLAG ─────────────
//
// Two rules, and they are different rules.
//
// ONE: a limit is never a JSON-Schema maxItems/minItems/maxLength. A schema bound cannot
// trim an over-long answer — the runtime rejects the WHOLE result, the caller receives a
// bare null it cannot tell from a dead agent, and the run halts. One really did, on 61
// items against a bound of 60, claiming files were unread that had been read. So a limit
// is STATED in the prompt and COUNTED here, once the result is in hand.
//
// TWO, and it decides whether a limit may be stated at all: a limit belongs at the layer
// where the data is CREATED, not where it is read. A dispatch that AUTHORS its output —
// criteria, findings, a persona, a draft — chooses its own volume, so a ceiling stated to
// it is a real instruction it can honour. A dispatch that READS or EXTRACTS — an
// inventory of what exists, the evidence found in a repository, the ids it was handed,
// what git printed — has a volume that is a property of the source. Telling it "at most
// N" instructs it to truncate, which loses information, or to lie. Those dispatches get
// NO stated ceiling; bounding what they may DRAW ON (which repository, which files) is
// the guard that works, and it already lives in their prompts. Where a read's volume
// genuinely ought to be smaller, the fix belongs upstream, in whatever made the data.
//
// BOTH kinds are still counted here, because a wildly unexpected count is exactly the
// signal worth having, and nothing is ever truncated, dropped, reordered or summarised at
// any multiple. The count is a GRADUATED FLAG: modestly over the expected figure is
// ordinary variation and reads as an observation; at SCRUTINY_MULTIPLE times it or more,
// the shape is no longer variation — it is what padding, a misread assignment or
// duplicated entries look like — and it is logged prominently so a person looks. 2x is
// the threshold because a single band has to sit above the honest overshoots this
// pipeline actually produces (61 against 60 is 1.02x; the worst recorded lens overshoot
// is well under 1.5x) and below the runaway enumerations the limits exist to catch. It is
// a flag for a person, never a thing the code acts on: neither branch alters control flow.

An edge from A to B says: an architecture decision B rests on should be designed from A's requirements first, because A's requirements are the fuller statement of what that decision must serve — sign-up and sign-in requirements drive the identity architecture, so password reset waits, or identity gets designed from a recovery flow's requirements alone. A reason that says something must exist, be built, be deployed or be testable first, that B presumes a user or a record exists, or that B reads data from or calls a capability of A, is a build dependency between Tasks and is never an Epic edge. ${a.sadPath ? `The SAD is ${a.sadPath}: a` : 'A'} decision the SAD already settles needs no edge; check it before drawing one. A SAD entry settles a decision ONLY when its frontmatter reads \`lifecycle_state: effective\` — read that field, never infer it from the wording. A dated ruling, a MUST and a table of values are properties of the prose, and an unvetted entry has more of them than a vetted one. An entry in any other state settles NOTHING and the test proceeds as though it were absent.`

${THE_TEST}

Work in this order:
1. Run these two commands, once each. Each prints one JSON object; if either exits non-zero, stop, set \`valid\` false, \`applyExitCode\` -1, \`applySummary\` {}, and put its output in \`error\`.
   ${cmd('assess-plan', `${scope} --out ${shq(planFile)}`)}
   ${cmd('assess-context', `${scope} --dir ${shq(contextDir)}${a.corpusReady ? ' --corpus-ready' : ''} --out ${shq(contextFile)}`)}
   They write: ${target}'s full PRD at ${epicPrd}; the PRD corpus at ${corpusDir}, one file per open Epic named <id>.md; the index at ${indexFile}, one line per open Epic with its title, elaboration state, PRD path and section headings; and ${contextFile}, whose \`standing\` lists every edge between ${target} and another open Epic, in either direction, as {from, to, type, owned, reason, confidence, setBy, setAt} — \`from\` is the Epic designed first, \`reason\` the one recorded when the edge was set, or null. \`withdrawn\` lists every edge touching ${target} that an earlier assessment WITHDREW, as {from, to, reason, withdrawnBy, withdrawnAt}: that edge was judged not to exist, for the reason recorded. Setting it again is admitted only when you answer that reason.${a.sadPath ? `\n   The SAD: ${a.sadPath}` : ''}
2. Read ${target}'s full PRD.
3. Name the architecture decisions its requirements should drive, and the architecture decisions it rests on.
4. Check each against the SAD, and drop every decision the SAD already settles. Search the SAD for the decision, and read the section you find — INCLUDING its frontmatter \`lifecycle_state\`. An entry settles the decision only when that field reads \`effective\`; in any other state it settles nothing, however normatively it is worded and whatever date it carries, and you proceed as though the entry were absent. Record, for each decision you keep, which section you consulted, the \`lifecycle_state\` you read there, and why it leaves the decision open — that record goes on every edge as \`sadCheck\`, and an edge without one is refused. Today every SAD entry is \`in-review\`, because no Epic has completed elaboration yet: expect to drop almost nothing at this step, and treat a decision you were about to drop on an \`in-review\` entry as open.
5. For each remaining decision, search the corpus with Grep, and the index for titles and sections, for the PRDs whose requirements drive or rest on it. Read no PRD the search did not find related.
6. Read in full every related PRD, and the PRD at the other end of every standing edge.
7. Apply the test in both directions: an edge from another Epic to ${target} where the architecture ${target} rests on should be designed from that Epic's requirements first, and an edge from ${target} to another Epic where that Epic's architecture should be designed from ${target}'s requirements first.
8. Write ${edgesFile} as {"edges": [{"from", "to", "reason", "confidence", "sadCheck", "answers"}], "withdrawn": [{"from", "to", "reason"}]}. \`sadCheck\` is required on every edge: the SAD section you consulted for the decision it orders, and why that section leaves the decision open. \`answers\` is required only on an edge the context's \`withdrawn\` list covers: state why the recorded withdrawal reason is wrong, on the architecture. An edge you cannot answer that way is not set — the earlier judgment stands. \`edges\` holds EVERY edge to or from ${target} that passes the test — a standing one it keeps included — and no edge that does not touch ${target}. \`withdrawn\` holds every standing edge with \`owned: true\` that is not in \`edges\`, with a reason that answers the reason recorded for it. Every reason names the architecture decision and whose requirements should drive it; \`confidence\` is \`high\`, \`medium\` or \`low\`. A standing edge with \`owned: false\` was made by hand: leave it out of both lists. Write the reasoning, per edge and per withdrawal, to ${reasoningFile}.
9. Validate: \`set -o pipefail; ${cmd('validate', `--edges ${shq(edgesFile)} ${scope}`)} | tee ${shq(validationFile)}\` — revise the file until \`ok\` is true, keeping to THE TEST: an edge that fails the test is dropped, never kept to satisfy the validator. It refuses an edge that does not touch ${target}, a missing reason, an edge with no \`sadCheck\`, an edge an earlier assessment withdrew that carries no \`answers\`, an owned standing edge left unaccounted, a withdrawal of an edge that is not an owned standing edge, and a cycle against every other Epic edge. A cycle you cannot remove by dropping one of your own edges that fails the test — one through an edge with \`owned: false\` — is reported, not forced: set \`valid\` false, put the validator's findings in \`findings\`, name the cycle in \`unsure\`, and do not run step 10 (\`applyExitCode\` -1, \`applySummary\` {}).
10. Only once validation passes, run exactly this, once: \`${applyCmd}\`. Return its exit code as \`applyExitCode\` and the \`summary\` object it printed, unaltered, as \`applySummary\`. Do not retry it or repair anything it refuses.

Return the edge file path, the reasoning file path, the edge count, whether the final validation passed, \`relatedRead\` — the id of every Epic whose PRD you read in full, other than ${target} — each edge you were unsure of with what would settle it, and the apply-edges result.`
