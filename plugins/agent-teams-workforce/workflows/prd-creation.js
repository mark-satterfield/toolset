const ownedCoreContracts = "---\nname: subagent-contract\ndescription: >-\n  Shared contract for bounded specialist assignments: preserve role and scope, follow\n  the caller's response format, retain verifiable artifacts, and report incomplete work explicitly.\nuser-invocable: false\n---\n\n# Subagent Contract\n\n## Caller contract comes first\n\nFollow the caller's exact response schema and artifact protocol. Do not prepend `STATUS`, restate the task, add report fields, or append commentary to a machine-consumed response. Put evidence, findings, progress and blockers only in the artifacts or fields the caller provides. An artifact's on-disk schema and the response-reference schema serve different purposes; do not return the artifact body when the caller requests only its path.\n\nWhen the caller supplies a response schema, your only reply is the StructuredOutput call that carries it; in artifact mode that call carries the `{artifactPath}` the submission tool emits. A prose report never substitutes for that call. Reserve your last turns for submission: when the turn budget runs low, stop working, put the remaining work in the schema's fields and submit.\n\nWhen an executable submission/checkpoint tool is supplied, use it to validate the authored result, compute bindings and construct the response. Return its successful response unchanged through the requested channel. Do not manually manufacture completion flags or hashes. Structural validation proves neither semantic correctness nor review approval. On failure preserve work and report the exact remaining work or blocker through the caller's supported mechanism; never send a success reference for an incomplete assignment. If the supplied protocol has no failure channel, report that incompatibility to the caller rather than inventing a successful response.\n\nOnly when the caller supplies no response format, use `STATUS: DONE` or `STATUS: BLOCKED` with a concise description of deliverables and verification, or the blocker and what is needed. Claim DONE only when the assigned work is complete and verified. No separate preliminary restatement or generic final report is required.\n\n## Role and scope\n\n- Perform only the role assigned in the agent definition and task. Do not invent requirements, select downstream work or enlarge your authority.\n- Identify the minimal relevant files, artifacts and decisions. Use only allowed tools and preserve file ownership. Read-only reviewers may write caller-authorized result/checkpoint artifacts, never source artifacts.\n- An explicit assignment to repair all baseline failures in an affected repository includes pre-existing failures there. Preserve test-author ownership and required checks; this does not authorize unrelated cleanup, other repositories or invented external resources.\n- Prefer small, reversible changes unless the assignment requires broader change. Report material actions and their outcomes in the existing evidence channel, without adding fields to a fixed schema.\n- Pipeline beads are always read and written in the central beads database, wherever you run: run every `bd` command as `atw-bd` with `bd`'s own arguments, never a plain `bd` (the `beads-contract` skill).\n- Missing required context is a named dependency, not permission to guess. Distinguish facts, justified assumptions and unresolved questions; do not silently complete only the easy portion.\n\n## Skills and authoritative artifacts\n\nRead canonical skill content already delivered in the prompt; do not reload it solely because its name also appears in frontmatter. Assess which other declared skills apply and load those through the Skill tool using their exact names. A name alone is not delivered content. A missing required skill is an explicit dependency; do not substitute recollection. Note material applicability decisions only in existing progress/evidence channels that permit them, never by expanding the return schema.\n\nRead the actual relevant source sections and connected contracts. Shared Markdown, vault notes, diagrams, schemas and JSON stay authoritative at their paths; summaries guide navigation and do not replace source verification. Observe assigned read/edit/create ownership. Preserve content unless its change is assigned. Pass references rather than copying whole documents between agents. When exact copying is required, use deterministic file tools rather than model transcription. Use version/provenance where relevant; do not require hashes merely for semantic editing.\n\nFor durable authoring, checkpoint meaningful progress using the caller's location and executable mechanism where supplied. Record completed work, remaining work and artifact references; blocked progress names the dependency and reason. Checkpoints are progress, not accepted results. On resume verify the checkpoint against actual artifacts and finish missing work without regenerating valid completed documents.\n\n## Resource use and incremental review\n\n- Use tokens conscientiously without compromising required correctness, completeness, safety or evidence. Before a material optional expansion, identify its unresolved need and expected benefit in existing progress. Routine tools need no justification. Do not add a report, review pass, token quota or human approval gate for this rule; omit optional work with no concrete benefit.\n- Makers and reviewers use the same applicable requirements, constraints and completion criteria. Review determines actual correctness, including passing sound work; finding more failures is not success. Do not invent requirements or turn stylistic preferences into blocking defects. Preserve necessary safety and regression checks.\n- Use the caller's finding format to identify the affected location, requirement/dependency at risk, observed evidence and actionable correction with a verifiable pass condition. Distinguish defects, missing evidence and proposed new requirements. Never claim unperformed checks passed.\n- Revise original artifacts incrementally. Retain valid work and applicable evidence. Rereview changed scope and affected dependencies; reopen accepted work only when new evidence or demonstrated impact invalidates its earlier evidence, and state why. Preserve required independent review.\n\n## Technical gaps are decided, not escalated\n\nWhere the approved or effective architecture, a requirement or an owner answer is silent, unclear or self-contradictory on a technical matter, decide it by best practice, with AWS Well-Architected guidance and AWS documentation as the evidence (see AWS evidence authority below). Record the decision, the gap it closes and its cited evidence in your result, and continue. A technical matter is any question of how the system works: services, patterns, interfaces, data, values and limits, security and privacy controls, cost and operations. A recorded decision is a claim reviewers check like any other; it is not an open item.\n\nTwo things go to the owner, through the channel the caller provides for them: two of the owner's business requirements that no design can satisfy together, and a conflict in arc42 section 2, which only the owner writes (constraints that contradict each other, or that no design can meet together with the business requirements). Nothing else does. Never put a technical question to the owner or any person, and never hold work waiting for a technical answer.\n\n## The approved architecture is authoritative\n\nThe approved (effective) architecture and the owner's answers are authoritative. Older documents, repository READMEs and existing code are evidence of the current state: they show what exists and what still has to change, never that the approved architecture or an owner answer is wrong. Where they disagree with the approved architecture, the approved architecture holds and the difference is work to plan, not a conflict to raise. The approved architecture changes only through a reviewed target backed by requirements and evidence, or a reviewed correction from what a Story built.\n\n## AWS evidence authority\n\nBefore any AWS claim, design choice or question, check the AWS MCP Server documentation tools (`search_documentation`, `read_documentation`, `retrieve_skill`) and the relevant AWS plugin skills (`aws-core:*`, for example `aws-core:aws-cdk`, `aws-core:aws-serverless`, `aws-core:aws-iam`, `aws-core:aws-networking`, `aws-core:aws-well-architected-review`), including the applicable Well-Architected principles. A question AWS documentation can answer is answered from it and never reaches the owner. Retain source references and the concrete tradeoffs. Existing generated architecture and model recollection do not establish correctness. Makers and reviewers use this same evidence criterion.\n\nApply guidance to stated requirements, deployment, usage and cost constraints rather than hypothetical scale. Where AWS guidance conflicts with a business requirement or a section 2 constraint, the requirement or constraint holds: record the conflict and the design that honours it, and do not silently substitute a preferred AWS pattern. Missing required MCP/skill access is a named blocker or uncertainty, never a passed check. Coordinators may research and route AWS questions, but cannot author or approve designs.\n"
const ownedArtifactContract = "---\nname: artifact-handoff\ndescription: Share authoritative documents, diagrams and JSON by artifact path, with format-specific validation and resumable checkpoints; never retype full payloads between agents.\n---\n\n## Executable output mode\n\nThe dispatcher selects `OUTPUT_MODE` from its response schema and validates an explicit mode against that schema before dispatch. `artifact` means a single `artifactPath` reference to a caller-specified candidate; the JSON candidate, progress and submission rules below apply. `inline` means a small caller-defined status, routing or control response: return that exact schema directly and do not invent candidate files or checkpoints. `machine` is the deterministic command runner protocol; its executable hook supplies the response and no model-authored payload is permitted. Merely loading this skill does not change the selected mode or grant write access. In standalone use without an explicit mode, apply artifact rules only when the caller supplies a candidate path and artifact schema; otherwise honor its inline response contract.\n\nShared documents, Markdown, diagrams and other artifacts stay in their authoritative files. Pass paths and brief task context; recipients read the actual files. A summary is navigation, never a substitute source. Edit only explicitly assigned files; preserve accepted work. Do not retype an entire document into another agent's prompt or machine response. Use existing deterministic file operations for exact copies when a copy is explicitly required.\n\nKeep the caller-specified checkpoint current after meaningful work: status, task, completed work, remaining work and artifact paths. On resume read the checkpoint and referenced artifacts, verify current state and complete remaining work. A checkpoint is progress evidence, never acceptance or permission to omit validation.\n\nFor JSON, write the caller's requested JSON object once to its exact candidate path. Use the supplied artifact schema; do not confuse it with the small return schema. Preserve existing completed work and inspect an existing candidate before continuing interrupted work. Return only the candidate path using the caller's structured return schema. Never copy the full artifact into StructuredOutput or prose.\n\nThe producer directly reads its inputs, authors its outputs and runs its own submission/checkpoint helper. The workflow's named command runner performs only coordinator acceptance and provenance operations: it invokes `scripts/portfolio/jsonartifact.py` with the expected candidate, final path and schema. The script rejects duplicate keys, invalid JSON, schema violations and changes to already accepted results. It writes canonical JSON and an integrity receipt; downstream scripts verify the receipt. Candidates stay outside the accepted result directory. A failed candidate is never treated as a completed step.\n\nThe command runner runs only the exact checked command supplied by the workflow. Validation failure is reported explicitly; it does not authorize rewriting another producer's content or repeating a successful administrative command. Existing legacy artifacts are preserved.\n\nFor Markdown and diagrams, `jsonartifact.py --document PATH` verifies the actual nonempty UTF-8 file and returns its path, raw-byte SHA-256, length and format. It never copies or rewrites the document. This receipt identifies the reviewed version; it is not a semantic quality verdict and does not prohibit later authorized edits. Keep structured metadata separate and refer to the document path instead of embedding its contents.\n\nCandidate completion checkpoints bind the exact candidate path, expected schema hash and caller revision. The workflow derives that revision from actual source-file/corpus byte fingerprints and assignment context; a path alone is not freshness evidence. Changed inputs require a new candidate revision. A saved complete result for the same revision is reused; it is never silently replaced. Fingerprints exclude the producer’s assigned output files to preserve interruption recovery.\n\n## Executable producer contract\n\nUse the caller's canonical schema for both production and review; architecture uses [writer](schemas/architecture-writer.schema.json) and [reviewer](schemas/architecture-review.schema.json). Never maintain a second schema in prose. The [checkpoint schema](schemas/checkpoint.schema.json) is shared by producer status commands.\n\nResolve `scripts/portfolio/artifactcontract.py` from this plugin's root (two directories above this skill). The workflow supplies the candidate path, canonical schema and input revision. Pass exactly one of `--schema-file PATH` or `--schema-json JSON`; both use identical strict parsing, validation and canonical hashing. Prefer the schema file when the caller supplies one. Author a small progress JSON file with `task`, `completed`, `remaining`, and `artifacts`; add `reason` when blocked. Do not put binding hashes or completion flags in that file: the helper computes them.\n\n```bash\npython3 \"$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/portfolio/artifactcontract.py\" checkpoint --candidate \"$CANDIDATE\" --schema-file \"$SCHEMA\" --revision \"$REVISION\" --progress-file \"$PROGRESS\" --status in-progress\npython3 \"$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/portfolio/artifactcontract.py\" complete --candidate \"$CANDIDATE\" --schema-file \"$SCHEMA\" --revision \"$REVISION\" --progress-file \"$PROGRESS\"\npython3 \"$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/portfolio/artifactcontract.py\" status --candidate \"$CANDIDATE\" --schema-file \"$SCHEMA\" --revision \"$REVISION\"\n```\n\nFor a dependency you cannot satisfy, checkpoint with `--status blocked` and its exact `reason` and remaining work. Do not mark incomplete reasoning complete merely to satisfy the schema. `complete` requires no remaining work, validates strict JSON against the canonical schema, canonicalizes the candidate and writes its bound checkpoint. Return only the candidate reference after that command succeeds. `validate` performs schema validation without mutation. Invalid commands return exit 2 with an explicit error.\n\n`complete-unaccepted` means structurally ready for the workflow's existing acceptance operation, not technically correct, approved, or shipped. Reviewers read the authoritative artifacts and independently judge evidence; mechanically valid metadata cannot establish their correctness. Status detects changed candidate bytes and changed input/schema bindings. Resume `in-progress`/`blocked` work from its actual artifacts; do not restart completed reasoning or silently retry an unchanged blocker.\n\nThe coordinator may use `scripts/portfolio/artifactpublish.py --record-argv-json JSON -- <jsonartifact acceptance arguments>` to validate/publish and record provenance in one deterministic invocation. The recorder receives argv, not shell text, and must name the accepted artifact. Pending or rejected candidates are never recorded; recorder failure reports failure and retains the accepted artifact for recovery. This replaces separate administrative agent calls without replacing specialist reasoning or independent review.\n\nFor the actual handoff use `submit` with the same arguments as `complete`: it validates and writes the checkpoint, then emits exactly the response object `{\"artifactPath\":\"...\"}`. Return that object unchanged. The schema describes the on-disk candidate; the response contains only its reference. A failed submission emits an error and never writes a new completion checkpoint. When the caller supplies `--files-root ROOT --files-field FIELD`, submission also verifies every path in that candidate field is relative to ROOT, stays inside it after symlink resolution, and names a nonempty regular file. These are declared authored outputs, not all assigned or future files. `--progress-artifacts-root ROOT` additionally checks explicitly declared progress artifact paths inside that root; use it only when the caller establishes that scope. These checks establish file existence and structure, not whether the reasoning is correct.\n"
const ownedBaselineContract = "---\nname: architecture-baseline\ndescription: Assess the effective architecture in arc42 against one PRD, find what it does not yet serve or represent, build out the architecture from non-effective documents, existing repository code and the AWS MCP Server where it falls short, and keep arc42 updated with a delta for every change. Selects justified retention, change, replacement, addition or retirement without assuming a new design is required.\nuser-invocable: false\n---\n\n# Assessing the effective architecture for a PRD\n\n## The architecture phase\n\nThe architecture is the current effective architecture in arc42: the canonical views whose `lifecycle_state` is `effective`. There is no separate baseline architecture. Every PRD builds on the effective architecture and leaves it updated, so it stays current as PRDs are processed. The architecture phase runs for every PRD and is never skipped; it is not architecture creation. It has three steps:\n\n1. **Assess.** Using the PRD as the guide, find and analyze the effective architecture to judge whether it meets the PRD's needs, capability by capability.\n2. **Build out.** Where the effective architecture does not completely serve the PRD, build it out from the non-effective architecture documents, with the code in the existing repositories on `main` as guidance and the AWS MCP Server as the authority on best practice (see below). Building out includes independent review and approval of the proposal.\n3. **Update arc42.** Integrate the approved result into arc42 as the new effective architecture, with a delta that records the change.\n\n## Authority and evidence\n\nRead the caller's architecture MODEL, specifically `reference/architecture-documentation-model.md#Assessing existing architecture and implementation` beneath the supplied architecture root when that is the project's model layout. The project model owns its document versions, review states and maintenance obligations; this skill applies them to bounded workflow assignments without inventing a second authority policy.\n\nThe owner's explicit instructions and applicable requirements and constraints establish what the work must accomplish. Apply their stated scope. Existing code, CDK, tests, drafts and incidental implementation choices are evidence of the current state; their existence does not make them binding decisions or make retention the goal. The effective architecture is a reviewed starting point, not an immutable prohibition on better justified changes. Read an actual decision and its applicability before treating it as authoritative; do not infer an owner decision from a file, an old implementation or an agent-authored statement.\n\nCompare the current system with the required target. Retain what is suitable; change, replace, add or retire what the evidence and requirements justify. Do not preserve stale design merely because it exists, and do not replace suitable work merely because a different design is possible. Explain the relevant requirement, defect, constraint or AWS guidance and the tradeoff behind a proposed change. A recommendation is evidence to assess in context, not an automatic requirement to redesign. Iteration is expected: preserve provenance and useful findings, revise the affected architecture and implementation work, and use normal Git history to make changes reviewable and reversible.\n\n## Evolve the architecture one PRD at a time\n\nAn effective document is the approved architecture under the knowledge and requirements available when it was approved, not a permanent constraint on future work. Assess the current PRD against the relevant effective views, repository behavior and connected contracts. Expand that scope only where the impact evidence requires it; do not load or redesign all PRDs to approve one. A later PRD may justify superseding a previously sound decision. Explain the new requirement or evidence, update the affected canonical views and implementation handoff, and retain unrelated valid decisions and review evidence. Unknown future requirements are not present constraints or reasons to block approval.\n\n## Assess the effective architecture before selecting work\n\nUse the caller's authoritative PRD, repository code on `main`, CDK, interfaces, data and event schemas, tests, existing arc42 views, open targets and relevant AWS documentation. Repository code and CDK represent the intended deployed system; no separate live-account inventory or deployment-access gate is required by this contract.\n\nArchitecture includes responsibilities, business behavior, interfaces, data, interactions and runtime flows as well as infrastructure. A Lambda or table declaration in CDK does not establish what the application does. For a behavioral capability, inspect the relevant implementation, entrypoints, wiring, contracts and tests. Keep behavioral evidence separate from infrastructure evidence. A test file is evidence of a test, not evidence that it passed. Cite precise sources and distinguish established behavior, inference and uncertainty. Only a genuinely infrastructure-only or documentation-only obligation may use that narrower scope; explain its applicability.\n\nRead each relevant document's actual `lifecycle_state`. `effective` and `in-review` are the existing review states; versions (`effective`, `target`, `delta`, `built`) describe the document's place in the architecture model. These dimensions are not interchangeable. An approved design need not have been implemented. Unreviewed documentation and existing code may be useful and correct, but still need validation. Missing documentation is not proof that code is absent; existing code is not proof that the required behavior is complete or suitable.\n\n## Check what the effective architecture does not yet represent\n\nEven when the effective views serve a capability, arc42 can hold content they do not yet reflect. For every capability the PRD needs, check it against:\n\n- the owner's constraints in section 2 (`02-architecture-constraints/`), including constraints added or changed since the effective views were approved;\n- canonical arc42 views still `in-review`, and other arc42 content not yet effective (for example section 4 strategy or section 8 concepts in review);\n- open targets under `target/` and build records under `built/` that show the capability's elements.\n\nAn open target is design input, not approved design. Its `baseline.json` records `arc42Revision`, the revision of the effective version it was designed against. When that revision is missing, or effective views of the same elements were approved after the target was written (their last commit in the vault is later than the target's), the survey and the Check judge the target possibly stale: validate each part against the current effective views before adopting it, and record in the assessment what was found superseded.\n\nA constraint or document that applies to the capability and that its effective views do not represent is a cited gap: name the constraint or document (path and heading) and the effective view that does not represent it. Give that capability `designAction` `modify` when the design must change to honour it, or `documentationAction` `update` when only the documentation lags; either places the capability in design scope. Content that does not apply to the PRD's capabilities is not in scope; mention it in the summary. When nothing is unrepresented, say so for each capability, with the documents checked. This check is part of every assessment and of every independent review of a capability left unchanged, including a review-only Check.\n\n## Build out from every available input\n\nWhen the effective architecture does not completely serve the PRD, authors build the target from:\n\n- the effective views, as the reviewed starting point;\n- the non-effective architecture documents named above, as design input: validate them and adopt what suits this PRD, rather than only avoiding contradiction with them;\n- the code in the existing repositories on `main`, as guidance: it may already be exactly the design the PRD needs, so reuse it when it is; it may also be stale and far out of date, so judge it against the PRD, the effective views and AWS best practice before following it, and never treat its existence as a reason to keep it;\n- the AWS MCP Server's documentation and skills (with the `aws-core` skills and AWS Well-Architected guidance), as the authority on best practice: every AWS design choice follows them, and where code or an older document disagrees with them, the best practice wins unless a business requirement or a section 2 constraint says otherwise.\n\n## Close over what the work rests on\n\nA PRD names the capabilities it needs, not the foundations they run on. The work of the approved delta rests on other elements the effective architecture shows: a table on its database cluster, the cluster on its network, a handler on its event bus or user pool, a service on a shared library or on a repository that does not exist yet. The handoff to implementation is complete only when every element the delta's work transitively rests on is built and current on `main`, is planned by an open bead of any Epic, or is itself carried as implementation work. After integration, the architecture step's Closure phase walks the effective views from every delta item and records each element that is absent, stale against the effective views, or planned elsewhere, with the repository that deploys it or the repository to create. These become prerequisite items: placed in their own repository, detailed and specified like any delta item, built by their own Tasks, and ordered before the Tasks that need them. A prerequisite an open bead already plans gets no new Task; the Tasks that need it are blocked by that bead. Existing code is evidence of the built state and may be stale; AWS best practice decides what the element must be.\n\n## Produce the canonical assessment\n\nThe caller supplies [the assessment schema](../artifact-handoff/schemas/architecture-baseline.schema.json) as `survey.baseline`. Each entry's `id` is exactly its surveyed capability name and its `requirements` match that capability's requirement references. Record the current state, required target, suitability evidence, rationale and unresolved conflicts. Do not use structural validity as a substitute for judging the evidence.\n\nKeep design, documentation and implementation actions separate:\n\n- A suitable approved design with missing implementation needs implementation work, not another design proposal.\n- Suitable existing behavior with missing or incomplete architecture documentation needs documentation and its review, without invented replacement code.\n- An existing unreviewed design may need validation and approval, or a bounded correction; it does not automatically need a competing proposal.\n- An unsuitable existing implementation may need change, replacement or retirement, including when its older documentation was approved.\n- A fully suitable, evidenced current capability can retain its design and implementation. Record that conclusion and evidence explicitly.\n- Different capabilities and repositories in one PRD may take different actions. Preserve those distinctions in the target and implementation handoff.\n\n`disposition` describes the implementation intent: retain, change, replace, add, retire or undetermined. It is not a document lifecycle state. Unknown evidence remains unknown; never convert it to absence, completion or permission to rebuild. The deterministic helper checks capability coverage, action consistency, required evidence categories and source freshness. It cannot establish that a cited handler implements the requirement: the appropriate independent reviewer must examine that meaning.\n\n## Bounded authoring, review and maintenance\n\nThe default is check and approve: a PRD the effective architecture and the code already serve, with nothing in arc42 left unrepresented, is independently verified and approved without design authoring. A finding in that review that the effective architecture lacks design or documentation sends the assessment back for reassessment of the affected capabilities, which then enter design scope. Select only the authors and reviewers needed for the assessed obligations and remaining gaps. No PRD automatically requires a database, API, integration, competing design or every specialty. Review relevant current claims and their affected dependencies; retain still-valid evidence when unrelated files change. Changes to cited behavior or connected contracts require targeted reassessment.\n\nWhen design authoring is needed, the coordinator names one of the selected existing authors as accountable for the combined target's coherence. This is an assignment within the chosen work, not a new agent, a fixed lead specialty or an extra dispatch. Assign that author the integration views and order its final reconciliation after the contributing outputs it needs exist. Other authors own their bounded subject views; no author must certify a later author's unwritten output. A review-only or unchanged assessment has no design owner because it has no design-authoring assignment.\n\nKeep maker, reviewer and approval responsibilities separate. An assessment does not approve a design, and a machine-generated unchanged handoff does not replace independent review. After approval, update every affected architecture view and its connected documentation at the appropriate scopes. Carry implementation additions, modifications, replacements and retirements into the TRD, specifications and tasks even when no new architecture authoring is needed. A durable unchanged target may carry zero design changes while still carrying implementation work.\n\nEvery change to the effective architecture has a delta: authored design or documentation changes are delta views beside the target, and approving existing in-review views is recorded in the target's delta handoff. A PRD the effective architecture already serves still gets a delta handoff that says so, with its implementation work.\n\nApproval leaves the covered canonical arc42 documentation correct and approved (`lifecycle_state: effective`); it does not claim implementation. Integrate reviewed target changes into the canonical views, correcting or removing superseded content at every affected scope. A target, delta or built document alone cannot satisfy canonical publication. Existing in-review canonical views may be approved in place after review; already correct and approved views need no gratuitous rewrite. Record the exact affected files so publication can be verified before completion.\n\nUse the caller's executable artifact submission and checkpoint commands. Preserve accepted work and provenance; update the assessment when its relevant inputs change.

// ── A LIMIT BELONGS WHERE THE DATA IS MADE, AND AN OVERAGE IS A FLAG ─────────────
//
// Two rules, and they are different rules.
//
// ONE: a limit is never a JSON-Schema maxItems/minItems/maxLength. A schema bound cannot
// trim an over-long answer — the runtime rejects the WHOLE result, the caller receives a
// bare null it cannot tell from a dead agent, and the run halts. One really did, on 61
// items against a bound of 60, claiming files were unread that had been read. So a limit
// is STATED in the prompt and COUNTED here, once the result is in hand.
//
// TWO, and it decides whether a limit may be stated at all: a limit belongs at the layer
// where the data is CREATED, not where it is read. A dispatch that AUTHORS its output —
// criteria, findings, a persona, a draft — chooses its own volume, so a ceiling stated to
// it is a real instruction it can honour. A dispatch that READS or EXTRACTS — an
// inventory of what exists, the evidence found in a repository, the ids it was handed,
// what git printed — has a volume that is a property of the source. Telling it "at most
// N" instructs it to truncate, which loses information, or to lie. Those dispatches get
// NO stated ceiling; bounding what they may DRAW ON (which repository, which files) is
// the guard that works, and it already lives in their prompts. Where a read's volume
// genuinely ought to be smaller, the fix belongs upstream, in whatever made the data.
//
// BOTH kinds are still counted here, because a wildly unexpected count is exactly the
// signal worth having, and nothing is ever truncated, dropped, reordered or summarised at
// any multiple. The count is a GRADUATED FLAG: modestly over the expected figure is
// ordinary variation and reads as an observation; at SCRUTINY_MULTIPLE times it or more,
// the shape is no longer variation — it is what padding, a misread assignment or
// duplicated entries look like — and it is logged prominently so a person looks. 2x is
// the threshold because a single band has to sit above the honest overshoots this
// pipeline actually produces (61 against 60 is 1.02x; the worst recorded lens overshoot
// is well under 1.5x) and below the runaway enumerations the limits exist to catch. It is
// a flag for a person, never a thing the code acts on: neither branch alters control flow.
//
// This block is identical in every workflow script on purpose. Workflow scripts have no
// import mechanism, so a shared helper is shared by being the same text everywhere.
