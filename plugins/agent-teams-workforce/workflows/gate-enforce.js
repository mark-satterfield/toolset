    'Reusable phase gate. Evaluates the caller\'s deterministic checks against the artifact first and loops on a failed one with no model turn. Competitive criteria are recorded as flags; only constitutive criteria go to an independent phase-gate-enforcer, which returns pass / loop / escalate. A gate with no constitutive criterion passes on its checks alone. With `mode: \'exhaustion\'` it asks the advantage-evaluator to rule proceed or one directed revision on a gate whose loops are spent.',

const ownedCoreContracts = "---\nname: subagent-contract\ndescription: Bounded specialist work in direct sessions, with file outputs and independent validation.\nuser-invocable: false\n---\n\n# Direct specialist session\n\nPerform the role in your definition. The brief gives a bead, input paths, output path and outcome;\nit supplies no procedures or schema. Load the skills in your frontmatter and read the applicable\ncontract before writing. The artifact-handoff skill is the shared producer/reviewer authority.\nWrite the result file; Python handles validation, acceptance, fingerprints and pipeline state.\nDo not invoke a Workflow, another agent, a command runner, a submission helper or StructuredOutput.\nDo not create receipts, revision bindings or checkpoint sidecars. If resumed, inspect and continue\nthe existing result and input files; retain completed valid work.\n\nOnly assigned files are writable. Reviewers may write their result, never the reviewed source.\nNever write arc42 section 2, expose secrets or touch apps/marketing repositories. Never run keeper\nor supervisor. Agents do not write pipeline beads; Python owns those writes. If reading beads is\nneeded, use the central atw-bd wrapper from beads-contract. No agent creates a bug or loose Task.\nRead repository AGENTS.md before an authorized repository edit; input-only reads do not require\nloading every repository's instruction tree.\n\nMissing inputs are named dependencies, not permission to invent facts. Distinguish observed\nfacts, assumptions and unresolved questions in the artifact's supported fields. Do not mark your\nown work approved. In elaboration, repository code is evidence of current design detail only;\nthe matrix is the sole built-state record, and Python derives implementation work from it.\n\n## Resource use and incremental review\n\n- Use tokens conscientiously without compromising required correctness, completeness, safety or evidence. Before a material optional expansion, identify its unresolved need and expected benefit in existing progress. Routine tools need no justification. Do not add a report, review pass, token quota or human approval gate for this rule; omit optional work with no concrete benefit.\n- Makers and reviewers use the same applicable requirements, constraints and completion criteria. Review determines actual correctness, including passing sound work; finding more failures is not success. Do not invent requirements or turn stylistic preferences into blocking defects. Preserve necessary safety and regression checks.\n- Use the caller's finding format to identify the affected location, requirement/dependency at risk, observed evidence and actionable correction with a verifiable pass condition. Distinguish defects, missing evidence and proposed new requirements. Never claim unperformed checks passed.\n- Revise original artifacts incrementally. Retain valid work and applicable evidence. Rereview changed scope and affected dependencies; reopen accepted work only when new evidence or demonstrated impact invalidates its earlier evidence, and state why. Preserve required independent review.\n\n## Technical gaps are decided, not escalated\n\nWhere the approved or effective architecture, a requirement or an owner answer is silent, unclear or self-contradictory on a technical matter, decide it by best practice, with AWS Well-Architected guidance and AWS documentation as the evidence (see AWS evidence authority below). Record the decision, the gap it closes and its cited evidence in your result, and continue. A technical matter is any question of how the system works: services, patterns, interfaces, data, values and limits, security and privacy controls, cost and operations. A recorded decision is a claim reviewers check like any other; it is not an open item.\n\nOwner-only facts (credentials, money and destructive actions outside AWS dev), irreconcilable business requirements and section 2 conflicts go through the caller's owner channel. Technical choices remain with the specialists. Never put a technical question to the owner or any person, and never hold work waiting for a technical answer.\n\n## The approved architecture is authoritative\n\nThe approved (effective) architecture and the owner's answers are authoritative. Older documents, repository READMEs and existing code are evidence of the current state: they show what exists and what still has to change, never that the approved architecture or an owner answer is wrong. Where they disagree with the approved architecture, the approved architecture holds and the difference is work to plan, not a conflict to raise. The approved architecture changes only through a reviewed target backed by requirements and evidence, or a reviewed correction from what a Story built.\n\n## AWS evidence authority\n\nBefore any AWS claim, design choice or question, check the AWS MCP Server documentation tools (`search_documentation`, `read_documentation`, `retrieve_skill`) and the relevant AWS plugin skills (`aws-core:*`, for example `aws-core:aws-cdk`, `aws-core:aws-serverless`, `aws-core:aws-iam`, `aws-core:aws-networking`, `aws-core:aws-well-architected-review`), including the applicable Well-Architected principles. A question AWS documentation can answer is answered from it and never reaches the owner. Retain source references and the concrete tradeoffs. Existing generated architecture and model recollection do not establish correctness. Makers and reviewers use this same evidence criterion.\n\nApply guidance to stated requirements, deployment, usage and cost constraints rather than hypothetical scale. Where AWS guidance conflicts with a business requirement or a section 2 constraint, the requirement or constraint holds: record the conflict and the design that honours it, and do not silently substitute a preferred AWS pattern. Missing required MCP/skill access is a named blocker or uncertainty, never a passed check. Coordinators may research and route AWS questions, but cannot author or approve designs.\n"
const ownedArtifactContract = "---\nname: artifact-handoff\ndescription: Shared file contracts for direct specialist sessions; producers and consumers read the same schemas and completion rules.\n---\n\n# Direct artifact handoff\n\nRead [Epic contracts](epic-contracts.md) for the artifact assigned to this session, including its\nfields, interpretation and completion criteria. JSON schemas are in [schemas/](schemas/).\nProducers and reviewers use this same contract; a reviewer cannot add unstated requirements.\n\nThe brief contains only a bead id, labeled absolute input paths, an absolute output path, and a\none-line outcome. Read the named files yourself. Write the complete result to the exact output\npath. Write only assigned outputs and, for architecture writers, the assigned draft views.\nFor a JSON output write one strict JSON value with unique keys; for a document write nonempty\nUTF-8 Markdown. Do not paste file contents into a response. A final reply may name the result path.\n\nPython validates the file against the schema, checks declared document citations, publishes the\ncanonical JSON, and records input/output fingerprints. The agent does not accept its own result,\nwrite receipts, compute revision bindings, submit StructuredOutput, or run artifact checkpoint or\nsubmission helpers. There is no machine mode or command-runner handoff in direct sessions.\nA structurally valid artifact is not automatically a semantically correct one.\n\nOn a corrective pass, read the labeled validation-errors input and the existing output, repair the\nspecific findings and affected references, and preserve valid work. On interruption retain the\nactual files; resumption continues those files. Do not fabricate completion for missing reasoning.\nNamed missing inputs or remaining uncertainties belong in the contract's existing evidence fields;\nnever add fields to a closed schema or return a success reference for absent work.\n"
const ownedBaselineContract = "---\nname: architecture-baseline\ndescription: Assess and evolve effective architecture using one shared author, reviewer and decider standard.\n---\n\n# Architecture baseline\n\nRead [the review standard](review-standard.md) before surveying, coordinating, authoring,\nreviewing, deciding or integrating architecture. That is the common completion basis.\nRead artifact-handoff's [Epic contracts](../artifact-handoff/epic-contracts.md) and the relevant\nschema there for input and output fields. Contract correctness and architecture correctness are\nseparate: Python validates structure; independent reviewers judge claims and coverage.\n\nAn effective view is reviewed design, not evidence of implementation and not a permanent\nconstraint on future PRDs. Preserve valid design and evidence, revise what current requirements\nchange, and fill the implementation-detail gaps in the affected views. Do not redesign unrelated\nhistorical debt. No fixed specialist quota applies; the coordinator selects bounded specialties.\n\nThe survey judges design and documentation, never built-ness. Python computes implementationWork\nfrom the matrix snapshot and cited view elements. Fresh survey code.state, implementationAction\nand disposition are unknown/unknown/undetermined; legacy values are compatibility context only.\nThe Closure agent walks views, never repository code or deployments; Python classifies its\nreached elements using the matrix. A missing or unknown matrix row creates implementation work.\nOpen Tasks elsewhere add blockers; they do not remove this Epic's work.\n"
