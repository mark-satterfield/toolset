# Prime Architecture Context

Load existing ADRs and specs into the session so Claude can give architecture-aware responses.

## Process

1. **Check if init has been run**: Read `CLAUDE.md` at the project root and check if it contains references to `docs/adr/` or `docs/openspec/specs/`. If CLAUDE.md does not exist or lacks design plugin references, output:

   ```
   CLAUDE.md does not have design plugin references. Run `/pmo:init` first to set up your project, then re-run `/pmo:prime`.
   ```

   Then stop. Do NOT proceed with scanning.

2. **Scan for ADRs**: Glob for `docs/adr/ADR-*.md` files. For each file:
   - Read the YAML frontmatter to extract `status` and `date`
   - Extract the title from the first `# ` heading
   - Read the `## Context and Problem Statement` section
   - Read the `## Decision Outcome` section to extract the key decision
   - Sort by ADR number

3. **Scan for specs**: Glob for `docs/openspec/specs/*/spec.md` files. For each file:
   - Read the YAML frontmatter to extract `status`
   - Extract the title from the first `# ` heading (e.g., `SPEC-0001: Web Dashboard`)
   - Read the `## Overview` section
   - Count the number of `### Requirement:` headings
   - Count the number of `#### Scenario:` headings
   - Sort by SPEC number

4. **Apply topic filter** (if `$ARGUMENTS` is not empty):
   - The topic argument is a free-text string for semantic matching
   - For each ADR, read the title, context/problem statement, and decision outcome
   - For each spec, read the title and overview
   - Determine relevance based on semantic similarity to the topic -- an artifact is relevant if the topic relates to any of its key concepts, technologies, domains, or concerns
   - For example: topic "security" should match ADRs about authentication, authorization, encryption, or access control
   - If no artifacts match the topic, output:
     ```
     No ADRs or specs matched the topic "{topic}". Try a broader term, or run `/pmo:prime` without a topic to see all artifacts.
     ```

5. **Handle edge cases**:
   - If `docs/adr/` does not exist: "The docs/adr/ directory does not exist. Run `/pmo:adr [description]` to create your first ADR."
   - If `docs/openspec/specs/` does not exist: "The docs/openspec/specs/ directory does not exist. Run `/pmo:spec [capability]` to create your first spec."
   - If neither directory has any artifacts: "No design artifacts found. Create an ADR with `/pmo:adr` or a spec with `/pmo:spec` first."
   - If ADRs exist but no specs (or vice versa), present whichever exists and note the other is empty

6. **Present results** using the appropriate output format below.

## Output

### Without topic filter (`/pmo:prime`):

```
## Architecture Context Loaded

Primed session with {N} ADRs and {M} specs.

### Architecture Decision Records

| ID | Title | Status | Key Decision |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| ADR-0001 | {title} | {status} | {one-sentence summary of decision outcome} |

### Specifications

| ID | Title | Status | Requirements |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| SPEC-0001 | {title} | {status} | {N} requirements, {M} scenarios |

### Quick Reference
- Check for drift: `/pmo:check [target]`
- Full audit: `/pmo:audit [scope]`
- List all artifacts: `/pmo:list`
```

### With topic filter (`/pmo:prime {topic}`):

```
## Architecture Context Loaded (filtered: "{topic}")

Primed session with {N} ADRs and {M} specs matching "{topic}".

### Matching ADRs

| ID | Title | Status | Relevance |
|----|-------|--------|-----------|
| ADR-XXXX | {title} | {status} | {why this matched the topic} |

### Matching Specs

| ID | Title | Status | Relevance |
|----|-------|--------|-----------|
| SPEC-XXXX | {title} | {status} | {why this matched the topic} |

### Summaries

**ADR-XXXX: {title}**
{2-3 sentence summary of context, decision, and rationale.}

**SPEC-XXXX: {title}**
{2-3 sentence summary of what the spec covers and key requirements.}

### Skipped (not relevant to "{topic}")
- ADR-XXXX: {title}
- SPEC-XXXX: {title}
```

## Rules

- This skill is READ-ONLY -- it MUST NOT modify any files
- MUST check for init before scanning -- do not silently proceed without design references in CLAUDE.md
- Topic filtering uses semantic matching, not keyword search -- leverage Claude's understanding of related concepts
- MUST include the "Skipped" section when using topic filter so the user knows what was excluded
- MUST include the "Summaries" section when using topic filter with 2-3 sentence summaries of each matching artifact
- If a section (ADRs or specs) is empty, omit that section's table rather than showing an empty table
- Sort ADRs by number, sort specs by number
- The "Key Decision" column should be a single sentence summarizing the decision outcome, not the full text
