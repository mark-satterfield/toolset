# Initialize Design Plugin

Set up the project's `CLAUDE.md` with architecture context so Claude sessions are design-aware.

## Process

1. **Check for existing CLAUDE.md**: Look for `CLAUDE.md` in the project root.

2. **If CLAUDE.md exists**:
   - Read it and check whether it already contains references to `docs/adrs/` AND `docs/openspec/specs/`
   - If BOTH references are present, report that the plugin is already configured and stop (see Output: Already Configured)
   - **Check for path mismatches**: If the file contains an `## Architecture Context` section (or similar like `## Architecture`, `## Design Context`) but references different paths than `docs/adrs/` or `docs/openspec/specs/`, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:
     - "Your CLAUDE.md has architecture references with different paths. Should I update them to the design plugin's standard paths (`docs/adrs/` for ADRs, `docs/openspec/specs/` for specs)?"
     - Options: "Yes, update paths" / "No, keep existing paths and add plugin section separately"
     - If the user says yes, update the existing paths in-place to match the plugin conventions
     - If the user says no, append the plugin's Architecture Context section below the existing one
   - If no architecture section exists at all, add the `## Architecture Context` section (see Content section below)
   - Do NOT duplicate content -- if the section exists but is incomplete, update it rather than appending a second copy

3. **If CLAUDE.md does not exist**:
   - Create a new `CLAUDE.md` at the project root with the `## Architecture Context` section
   - This is the expected first-run case -- do not treat it as an error

4. **Report what happened** using the appropriate output format below.

## Content to Add

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/claude-md-template.md` (the plugin root's `references/` directory, one level above this skill's directory) and add its contents to CLAUDE.md. If CLAUDE.md already has other content, append the template at the end.

## Idempotency Rules

- Before adding content, ALWAYS check if `CLAUDE.md` already contains the string `docs/adrs/` AND `docs/openspec/specs/`
- If both strings are present, do NOT modify the file -- report "already configured"
- If the `## Architecture Context` heading exists but is missing one of the references, add the missing reference to the existing section rather than creating a new section
- If the file contains architecture references with DIFFERENT paths (e.g., `docs/decisions/` instead of `docs/adrs/`, or `openspec/specs/` instead of `docs/openspec/specs/`), ask the user before modifying -- do NOT silently add conflicting paths
- NEVER append a duplicate `## Architecture Context` section
- NEVER generate ad-hoc warnings or suggestions about path mismatches -- use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user decide

## Output

### When CLAUDE.md is created (first run):

```
## Design Plugin Initialized

Created CLAUDE.md with architecture context.

### What was created:
- New CLAUDE.md at project root
- Reference to `docs/adrs/` (Architecture Decision Records)
- Reference to `docs/openspec/specs/` (OpenSpec Specifications)
- Design plugin usage hints

### Next steps:
- Create your first ADR: `/pmo:adr [description]`
- Create your first spec: `/pmo:spec [capability]`
- Prime a session with context: `/pmo:prime [topic]`
```

### When CLAUDE.md is updated (exists but missing references):

```
## Design Plugin Initialized

CLAUDE.md updated with architecture context.

### What was added:
- Reference to `docs/adrs/` (Architecture Decision Records)
- Reference to `docs/openspec/specs/` (OpenSpec Specifications)
- Design plugin usage hints

### Next steps:
- Create your first ADR: `/pmo:adr [description]`
- Create your first spec: `/pmo:spec [capability]`
- Prime a session with context: `/pmo:prime [topic]`
```

### When already configured (idempotent re-run):

```
## Design Plugin Already Configured

CLAUDE.md already contains architecture context references. No changes made.

- ADR path: docs/adr/
- Spec path: docs/openspec/specs/
```

## Rules

- MUST be idempotent -- running twice produces no duplicate content
- MUST NOT remove or modify any existing content in CLAUDE.md
- MUST append the Architecture Context section after existing content, not prepend
- If CLAUDE.md does not exist, create it -- this is the normal first-run case, not an error
- Do NOT create `docs/adrs/` or `docs/openspec/specs/` directories -- those are created by `/pmo:adr` and `/pmo:spec` when needed
