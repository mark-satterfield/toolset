# Enrich Issues with Developer Workflow Conventions

You are retroactively adding `### Branch` and `### PR Convention` sections to existing tracker issues that were created by `/pmo:plan` (or manually) for a given spec.

## Process

1. **Parse arguments**: Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - Spec identifier: a SPEC number (e.g., `SPEC-0007`) or capability directory name
   - `--branch-prefix <prefix>`: Custom branch prefix instead of the default `feature`/`epic` prefixes
   - `--dry-run`: Preview what would be added without modifying any issues

   If no spec identifier is provided, list available specs by globbing `docs/openspec/specs/*/spec.md`, read the title from each, and use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which spec to enrich.

2. **Resolve spec**: Follow the plugin's `references/shared-patterns.md` § "Spec Resolution".

3. **Read spec**: Read `docs/openspec/specs/{capability-name}/spec.md` to get the spec number and understand the requirements.

4. **Detect tracker**: Follow the "Tracker Detection" flow in the plugin's `references/shared-patterns.md`. If no tracker is found, error — enrichment requires a tracker.

5. **Read `.claude-plugin-design.json` branch/PR config**: Check for saved preferences:

   ```json
   {
     "branches": {
       "enabled": true,
       "prefix": null,
       "epic_prefix": "epic",
       "slug_max_length": 50
     },
     "pr_conventions": {
       "enabled": true,
       "close_keyword": null,
       "ref_keyword": "Part of",
       "include_spec_reference": true
     }
   }
   ```

   - If `branches.enabled` is `false`, skip `### Branch` sections entirely
   - If `pr_conventions.enabled` is `false`, skip `### PR Convention` sections entirely
   - Use `branches.prefix` as the default task prefix (overridden by `--branch-prefix`)
   - Use `branches.epic_prefix` for epic issues (default: `epic`)
   - Use `branches.slug_max_length` for slug truncation (default: 50)
   - Use `pr_conventions.close_keyword` if set; otherwise use tracker-specific defaults
   - Use `pr_conventions.ref_keyword` for epic/spec references (default: "Part of")

6. **Find existing issues**: Search the tracker for issues referencing the spec number.
   - **GitHub**: `gh issue list --search "SPEC-XXXX" --json number,title,body,labels --limit 100`
   - **Gitea**: Use MCP tools (discovered via `ToolSearch`)
   - **GitLab**: Use MCP tools or `glab issue list --search "SPEC-XXXX"`
   - **Jira**: Use MCP tools with JQL containing the spec number
   - **Linear**: Use MCP tools to search issues containing the spec number
   - **Beads**: Use `bd list` or similar to find tasks referencing the spec

7. **For each issue**:

   a. Read the current issue body (via tracker API or CLI).

   b. Check if a `### Branch` section already exists in the body. If yes, skip adding it (idempotent).

   c. Check if a `### PR Convention` section already exists in the body. If yes, skip adding it (idempotent).

   d. Determine the slug from the issue title:
      - Convert to kebab-case (lowercase, spaces and special characters replaced with hyphens)
      - Truncate to max 50 chars (or `branches.slug_max_length` from `.claude-plugin-design.json`)
      - Remove trailing hyphens after truncation

   e. Determine if the issue is an epic:
      - Title starts with "Implement " → epic
      - Has an `epic` label → epic
      - Otherwise → task

   f. If `### Branch` section is missing and `branches.enabled` is not `false`, append:
      ```
      ### Branch
      `{prefix}/{issue-number}-{slug}`
      ```
      Where `{prefix}` is:
      - For epics: `epic` (or `.claude-plugin-design.json` `branches.epic_prefix` or `--branch-prefix`)
      - For tasks: `feature` (or `.claude-plugin-design.json` `branches.prefix` or `--branch-prefix`)

   g. If `### PR Convention` section is missing and `pr_conventions.enabled` is not `false`, append:
      ```
      ### PR Convention
      {close-keyword} #{issue-number}
      {ref-keyword} #{epic-number} (SPEC-XXXX)
      ```
      Tracker-specific close keywords: see the plugin's `references/shared-patterns.md` § "PR Close Keywords".

   h. **Auto-create labels** (Governing: SPEC-0011 REQ "Auto-Create Labels"): When applying labels like `epic` or `story` during enrichment, use the **try-then-create pattern**: attempt to apply the label, and if the tracker returns a "label not found" error, create the label with a default color (epic=#6E40C9, story=#1D76DB, spec=#0E8A16, other=#CCCCCC) and retry.

   i. Update the issue body with the appended sections using the tracker API or CLI.

8. **`--dry-run` mode**: If `--dry-run` is set, show what sections would be added to which issues but don't modify anything:
   - For each issue: show the issue number, title, and which sections would be added
   - Show the exact content that would be appended
   - Indicate issues that would be skipped (already have the sections)

9. **Report results**: Provide a summary:
   - Number of issues enriched (had sections added)
   - Number of issues skipped (already had sections)
   - Any failures encountered (with issue numbers and error details)
   - Breakdown: how many got `### Branch`, how many got `### PR Convention`

## Config Reference

This skill reads the `branches` and `pr_conventions` sections of `.claude-plugin-design.json`. See the plugin's `references/shared-patterns.md` § "Config Schema" for the full schema and § "Branch Naming Conventions" and "PR Close Keywords" for conventions.

## Rules

- MUST NOT overwrite existing `### Branch` or `### PR Convention` sections (idempotent)
- Branch slug MUST be derived from issue title (kebab-case, max 50 chars), not invented
- PR close keywords MUST match the detected tracker
- MUST use `ToolSearch` for tracker tools at runtime
- Failures on individual issues MUST be reported but MUST NOT stop processing remaining issues
- MUST check `.claude-plugin-design.json` for saved tracker preference and branch/PR config before processing
- MUST use try-then-create pattern for all label applications — never fail on missing labels (Governing: SPEC-0011 REQ "Auto-Create Labels")
- No `--review` support (utility skill)
